# The data is a list of:
# TIME PROCESS-ID PRIORITY
# Each is a number.  The PROCESS-ID should identify a particular
# process.  If nothing is scheduled (the CPU is idle), it should
# be -1.
#
# Think the times as when the given process *starts* running.
# That process *stops* running when the next one starts (or
# when the CPU goes idle).  Thus, there should be a final
# entry that specifies when the last process stopped --
# that is, the time your simulation ended.  You are probably
# best off just generating one using the time the simulation
# stops and the -1 (idle) process ID.
#
# Plot process data by opening up the .html file in your
# browser, closing the "terminal" window on the web page,
# and then running the send_job_data.py file giving it
# the data as its standard input.  For example:
#    cat test.txt | ./send_job_data.py

0    0  0
1    1  1 # Higher priority queue
2    2  0
4   -1  0 # -1 means it goes idle
4.5  3  1 # Fractional times are okay
8   -1  0
